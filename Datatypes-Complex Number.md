# 🧮 Bitwise shift operation on the user given integers in python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integer from the user and perform the bitwise left shift and right shift operation and print the output

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` 
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b`
3. Print the right shift operation of two varaible using `>>`
4. Print the left shift operation of two variable using `<<`


## 💻 Program
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a >> b)
print(a << b)
```

## Output

![bitwise operation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/277e8341-54ee-4b1b-affe-ac935b0e21dd)

## Result
Thus a Python program that reads two integer from the user and perform the bitwise left shift and right shift operation is created.
